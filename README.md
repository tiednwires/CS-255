Collection of projects from CS 255 System Analysis and Design


Project Summary

The DriverPass project was a system design assignment for a fictional client, DriverPass, an organization that helps students prepare for and pass their driver’s license exams. The client needed a software system that could support a wide range of user interactions, including registering for accounts, purchasing prep packages, scheduling driving lessons, managing appointments, and communicating with the DMV. The goal was to design a system that met both the functional and technical needs of students, administrators, secretaries, and other user roles.


What I Did Well

I’m particularly proud of how I organized the use case and activity diagrams. I focused on making the diagrams clear, consistent, and readable for both technical and nontechnical audiences. I also put a lot of effort into mapping out realistic user interactions and data flows that would make the system intuitive and efficient.


What I Would Revise

If I had more time to revise, I would go back and refine some of the class and sequence diagrams. In particular, I’d want to make the relationships between classes more detailed and consistent by adjusting multiplicity and clearly marking associations like <> or <>. That would make the design more precise and scalable.


Understanding and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by closely reviewing the interview transcript and business requirements. I made sure the system design reflected key features users would expect, like scheduling lessons, receiving confirmation emails, and accessing progress reports. Considering user needs is crucial because the success of a system depends on how well it serves its real-world users. A technically sound system is useless if it doesn’t support what users actually need to do.


My Approach to Software Design

When designing software, I like to start with the big picture, identifying the main users, what they need to do, and how the system will support those goals. I break things down into user stories and diagrams before thinking about the technical details. Moving forward, I’ll continue using strategies like UML diagrams, stakeholder interviews, and iterative prototyping to ensure I understand the problem before jumping into a solution.
